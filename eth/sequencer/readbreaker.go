// readFailuresToTrip is how many consecutive unanswered reads open the
// breaker. One is too eager — a single transient error would skip the
// pre-seal mirror check for a whole probe interval — and a larger number
// pays another full read budget per block before it helps.
const readFailuresToTrip = 2

// staleReadsToTrip is how many consecutive reads that reach the live tail at
// an unchanged head open the breaker. A gateway cut from its broker keeps
// answering from a window that no longer advances -- an answer, so the
// silence path never fires -- and the producer, reading the same held height
// every retry, refuses to seal until the fault clears. Treating a tail that
// does not move as one that does not answer keeps production off it.
const staleReadsToTrip = 6

// readProbeInterval is how often an open breaker lets one read through to
// look for the path again. It bounds the recovery delay and the steady-state
// cost of an outage together, and the two pull in opposite directions: the
// probe pays a full read budget when the path is still silent, so probing
// once a second cost most of a block at a one-second cadence and recovered
// only two thirds of the lost throughput on a devnet. Five seconds matches
// the write path's probe cap and puts the cost near a twentieth of that,
// for a recovery delay nobody watching block times would notice. Var for
// tests.
var readProbeInterval = 5 * time.Second

// readProbeTimeout bounds the one read an open breaker lets through. A probe
// asks a single question — does the path answer — so it gets a deadline
// sized for that rather than for returning a useful tail: on a silent path
// the full read budget is spent to learn nothing, and once per interval that
// was the whole of the throughput still missing on a devnet (12 probes of
// 1.25 s across a 60 s outage, a 25 % loss against a measured 27 %).
//
// A path too slow to answer inside it keeps the breaker open, which is the
// right answer anyway: a store that cannot reply in 150 ms has no business
// on the block path. Recovery is unaffected — a healthy store answers a
// Range in single-digit milliseconds.
var readProbeTimeout = 150 * time.Millisecond

// errReadPathDown is what a refused read returns. Callers already treat any
// read error as "the tail is unreadable" and take the safe branch, so a
// refusal needs no handling of its own — it only has to not look like
// NOT_FOUND, which is an answer.
var errReadPathDown = errors.New("store read path not answering")

// readBreaker keeps block production off a read path that is not answering.
//
// Every store read on the producer's critical path has a budget, and a
// gateway that accepts the connection without ever replying burns all of it,
// on every block: that is how a consumer-side outage turns into a block
// production slowdown. The reads are advisory — each one's caller already
// has a safe answer for an unreadable tail — so once the path has gone quiet
// the honest thing is to take that answer immediately instead of paying for
// it. One probe per interval finds the path again, which is also what closes
// the breaker: there is no other way to learn that a silent path is back.
